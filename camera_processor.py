    Maps calibrated phone pose actions to standardized robot action inputs.

    This processor step acts as a bridge between the phone teleoperator's output
    and the robot's expected action format. It remaps the phone's 6-DoF pose
    (position and rotation) to the robot's target end-effector pose, applying
    necessary axis inversions and swaps. It also interprets platform-specific
    button presses to generate a gripper command.

    Attributes:
        platform: The operating system of the phone (iOS or Android), used
            to determine the correct button mappings for the gripper.
